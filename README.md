How to Play

This is a turn-based battle game where the player faces off against a bot in a tactical fight. Both players can attack, heal, and charge up for powerful moves. Your goal is to find the keys to unlock the the boss and defeat them to move over to the next level.

Each Level would involve you needing to find 3 different keys before you are able to fight the boss in order to move to the next level. As the level progress, the keys will be much harder to find and the boss difficulty will increase.


The Player control consists of these follow buttons

Attack 1: A basic attack that can be used multiple times.

Attack 2: A special attack that can only be used once but may return after each use with a 70% chance.

Attack 3: Another special attack with stronger damage, also limited to one use per battle but with a 70% chance of returning.

Attack 4: A very strong attack, also limited to one use, with a 70% chance of coming back.

Heal: You can heal yourself up to two times during the battle. Healing restores 30 health points.

Charge Attack: This attack becomes available after using 3 normal attacks and deals significant damage.


Completing the level

You win the game if you reduce the bot's health to 0 before your health reaches 0.

You lose if your health drops to 0 first.


The game will display messages throughout the match, letting you know the status of each action and how much health you or the bot have left after every turn.

Good luck and plan your moves wisely!
